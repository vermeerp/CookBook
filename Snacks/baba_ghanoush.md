## Ingredients

- 2 pounds eggplant (2 medium or 1 large), whole and unpeeled
- ¼ cup tahini (sesame paste)
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 1 large clove garlic, crushed
- ¼ cup finely minced onion
- Salt, if desired, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon oil, preferably olive (optional)
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

## Instructions

- Prick the eggplant in several places with a fork, place it on a baking sheet, and broil it in a preheated broiler for about 20 minutes, turning the vegetable several times so that the skin chars on all sides. Let the eggplant cool.
- When the eggplant is cool enough to handle, cut it in half, scrape out the flesh into a bowl, discard the skin, and mash the eggplant with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper. Cover the mixture, and refrigerate it.
- Before serving, sprinkle the spread with oil, if desired, and minced parsley, and serve it with pita, fresh or toasted, or as a dip for fresh vegetables.
