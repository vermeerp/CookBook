## Ingredients

- 1⁄8 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 2 teaspoons minced onion
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
- 1 large onion, minced
- 1 to 2 cloves minced garlic, to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 cups cooked chickpeas (garbanzos), drained and rinsed if canned
- 1⁄2 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
- Salt, if desired, to taste
- 1⁄4 cup tahini (sesame paste)
- 1⁄2 cup sesame seeds, toasted and ground

## Instructions

- Sauté the onion and garlic in the oil until the vegetables are soft. Set the mixture aside.
- In a blender or food processor, purée the chickpeas with the onion and garlic, lemon juice, soy sauce, salt, tahini, and sesame seeds.
- Place in the jar of a blender the beans, peppers (if used), vinegar, chili powder, and cumin. Blend the ingredients until they are smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.
- Stir in the onion and parsley, and serve.

## Notes

- Hummus can be made hours ahead
- If tahini is unavailable, you can make it in a blender by combining 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1⁄2 teaspoon of oil, 2 tablespoons of water, and 1⁄4 cup of finely ground sesame seeds
- Serve with pita, fresh or toasted, and/or as a dip for fresh vegetables
- More complicated to prepare than usual versions, but worth the extra effort
