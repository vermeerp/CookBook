## Ingredients

- 1 cup (6 3/4 ounces) kasha (coarse-cut, roasted buckwheat groats)
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing
- 1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon fine salt, divided, plus more to taste
- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola
- 1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced into half moons
- 12 ounces cremini or white button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

## Instructions

- Position a baking rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees
- In a large skillet over medium-high heat, toast the buckwheat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and darker brown, 3 to 5 minutes
- Lightly grease a 1 1/2 quart covered casserole dish with butter. Add the toasted kasha and 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine
- Pour the boiling water over and dot the top with butter. Cover and place in oven
- Bake until liquid is absorbed, 20-35 minutes, checking at 20-minute mark. Fluff with fork when done
- While kasha bakes, wipe out skillet and return to medium heat. Add oil and heat until shimmering
- Add onion and cook until softened and lightly golden, about 15 minutes
- Add mushrooms, remaining salt and pepper, increase heat to medium-high
- Cook mushrooms and onions until water evaporates and they're nicely browned, 12-15 minutes
- Transfer mixture to a bowl and cover to keep warm
- Return pan to medium heat, add eggs and cook sunny side-up, over-easy or as desired

## Notes

- Check kasha at 20-minute mark and every 5 minutes after if liquid remains
- Keep mushroom-onion mixture warm while cooking eggs
- Can adjust seasoning to taste with additional salt and pepper
