## Ingredients

-  3 lbs or 3 medium zucchini
-  1 small onion, finely chopped
-  1 celery stalk, finely chopped
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 tbsp olive oil
-  1/2 tsp oregano, dried
-  1/2 tsp basil, dried
-  1/4 tsp thyme, dried
-  1/2 tsp salt
-  Ground black pepper, to taste
-  1 lb ground turkey
-  1/4 cup red or white wine
-  14 oz can tomato sauce, low sodium
-  1/4 cup broth or water
-  1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
-  Basil or parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

- Prep zucchini by slicing in half and scooping out the seeds and core in the middle with a tablespoon 
or ice cream/cookie scoop. Set aside.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
- Add 1/4 cup broth or water to 9 x 13 baking dish and lay zucchini in it. Set aside.
- Preheat large skillet on medium heat and swirl oil to coat. 
- Add onion, celery and garlic, saute for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Add dried oregano, basil, thyme, salt and pepper and saute for 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Add ground turkey and cook for 7 minutes, constantly stirring and breaking into small pieces.
- Add wine and half can of tomato sauce. Stir, bring to a boil and simmer for a few minutes. Turn off heat.
- Divide meat mixture between zucchini boats evenly.
- Spoon remaining tomato sauce on top
- Sprinkle with cheese.
- Bake for 25 minutes uncovered.
- Remove from the oven, garnish with basil or parsley and serve hot, warm or cold.

## Notes

-  Refrigerate leftovers covered tightly for up to 3 days. I do not recommend to freeze boats before or after 
cooking. Zucchini doesn't freeze well due to its high water content.
