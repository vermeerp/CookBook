```
From Jane Brody's `Good Food Book`

## Ingredients

- 1 - 1.5 lbs boneless chicken
- 1/4 tsp turmeric
- 1/8 tsp saffron threads, crushed
- 2 Tbsp warm water
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp salt, if desired
- 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, divided
- 1.5 cups long-grain brown rice
- 1 large garlic clove
- 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
- 2.5 - 3.5 c. chicken broth
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 tsp paprika
- 28 oz. canned tomatoes with their juices
- red pepper flakes to taste
- 2 tsp dried parsley flakes
- 1 10 oz. package frozen corn
- 1/2 c. black olives

## Instructions

- Cut the chicken into small pieces.
- Make a marinade of the turmeric and saffron with the warm water stirring to dissolve the saffron.
- Add the lemon juice, salt and 1 Tbsp oil.  Pour the marinade over the chicken, tossing the pieces to coat them.
- Refrigerate for 30  minutes or longer.
- Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet.  Remove the chicken from the marinade, 
reserving the marinade.  Brown the chicken and then remove from the pan.
- Add the rice to the pan and "fry" it for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring it constantly to coat it with oil 
and toast the grains.  
- Stir in the garlic and onion and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes, still stirring.
- Transfer the rice-vegetable mixture to a Dutch oven, and then add 2.5 cups broth, the oregano, pepper,
and paprika.  Stir the ingredients to combine them, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the
pot tightly, and cook the rice for 30 minutes.
- Stir in the reserved marinade (if any), tomatoes, and their juice, red pepper, and parsley, arrange
the chicken pieces on top of the rice, cover the pot, and cook over low heat for 30 minutes or until the 
chicken is nearly done.  Check once or twice and add more broth if needed.
- Sprinkle the corn, and olives over the top of the chicken, add more broth if needed, and cook another 
10 to 15 minutes, or until the chicken is tender, the rice fairly dry, and the corn hot.

## Notes

- Original recipe calls for peas instead of corn, and also pimientos.
