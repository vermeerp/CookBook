# Spinach Lasagna Noodles

These noodles are very difficult to find in a regular grocery store. I decided to make them homemade. You can make this up to a day ahead before using them.

## Ingredients

- 8 oz fresh spinach stems removed (or frozen spinach drained)
- 1 Tbsp olive oil 
- 2 eggs 
- 2 c all purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt

For Boiling the Pasta
- 1 Tbsp olive oil 
- 1 Tbsp salt

## Instructions

- Wash the Spinach by rinsing several times under water. Strain.
- Take the wet leaves and place in a pot covered. Cook until wilted. You do not need to add more water. The wet leaves will do. Rinse and cool under cold water and strain well. Squeeze a little water out.
- Place spinach,eggs,oil,and salt in a blender and puree mixture. 
- Take the 2 cups of flour and place in bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour.
- Pour spinach mixture into well,and mix with a fork. If it is dry, add a little water at a time to get an elastic, but not sticky dough. If too sticky add more flour.
- Place on floured surface and knead for 10 minutes,and let the dough rest for 10 more minutes. 
  - Optionally, use stand mixer and knead for 2 minutes on speed 2, then knead by hand for another 1-2 minutes
- Cut dough in half. Roll dough half out on lightly floured surface, in a 13x12 inch rectangle. You can trim the edges with a knife to make a perfect rectangle,and reserve dough for other batch. 
- With a knife cut dough into 2 inch wide noodles. Place on a rack for at least 10 minutes before cooking.
- In a wide pan bring water to a rapid boil. Add a tablespoon of olive oil,and a tablespoon of salt to water. 
- Boil noodles for about 20 minutes. 
- Rinse under cold water and place between wax paper or parchement paper. 
- You can refrigerate up to 24 hours,or use right away.
