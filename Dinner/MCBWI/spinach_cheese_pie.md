- 1 cup small curd cottage cheese

- Drain the spinach well and add the eggs
- Crumble the feta cheese well and add it
- Add the small curd cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg
- Mix well
- Brush the bottom of an 11x17 inch pan with butter
- Lay a sheet of phyllo dough on the bottom
- Brush the top of the sheet with more butter (need to moisten the whole sheet)
- Repeat this for 1 or 2 more sheets so you have 2 - 3 sheets at the bottom
- Now spread some of the mixture on top for another layer
- Keep layering until you finish your mixture
- You might want to put 3 sheets on the top of the entire pie
- Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes
- Remove the foil and bake for 1-2 minutes more
- Then serve

## Notes

- The phyllo dough should be kept covered with a damp towel while working to prevent drying
- Can be assembled ahead and refrigerated before baking
