## Ingredients

- 2 large chicken breasts
- 8 cups chicken broth
- 1 2/3 cups uncooked wild rice blend
- 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup salted butter
- 3 large stalks celery, diced
- 4 large carrots, diced
- 1/2 large yellow onion, diced
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tsp parsley
- 3/4 tsp thyme
- 1/2 tsp sage
- salt & black pepper, to taste
- 2 cups heavy cream (can substitute partially with milk)

## Slow Cooker Instructions
- Cook all ingredients except flour, butter, and cream on low 5-8 hours
- Once chicken is cooked and veggies have reached desired tenderness, remove chicken from pot.
Allow the chicken to rest.
- While the chicken rests, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until totally combined – let cook (it will be bubbling quite a bit) for 1 minute. 
- Stir in the heavy cream slowly, whisking constantly to keep the mixture smooth. 
- Add to the crock pot and stir it in. 
- Cut up the chicken and return it to the crock pot. 
- Taste and add more seasoning if desired.

## Stove Top Instructions

- Cook chicken in boiling salted water for 12-15 minutes until 165°F in center
- Shred or cut chicken into bite-sized pieces
- Combine chicken and broth in large pot, bring to boil
- Add rice and seasonings, cover and remove from heat
- In separate pan, melt butter and cook vegetables with spices for 6-8 minutes
- Add flour to vegetables, cook for 5 minutes
- Stir in cream until mixture is smooth
- Cook 3-4 more minutes to thicken
- Combine cream mixture with broth, rice, and chicken
- Simmer on low for 10-15 minutes until rice is done
- Adjust seasonings to taste

## Notes

- Using Rice Select's Royal Blend is recommended over 100% wild rice
- Soup will thicken naturally when stored in refrigerator
- Serve with crusty bread
