*Store:* Refrigerate covered for up to 3 – 4 days. Do not freeze.

*To reheat:* Simmer on low heat in a skillet for 5 minutes covered. If you use non-stick skillet you should not need any water or oil to reheat the dish as again zucchini will release water.

## Notes
Do not over cook zucchini. Follow the recipe and do not cook until zucchini appear soft and cooked. They comprise of 95% water and the longer you cook squash, the more water it releases.
