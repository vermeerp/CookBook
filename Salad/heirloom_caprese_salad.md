# Heirloom Caprese Salad

```
Prep Time: 15 minutes
Resting Time: 30 minutes
```

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds mixed heirloom or other fresh, ripe tomatoes
- 8 oz. burrata or mozzarella cheese, preferably fresh or packed in water
- Handful of fresh basil leaves (smaller look prettier)
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp flaky salt or 1/4 tsp kosher salt, to taste
- Fresh ground pepper

## Instructions

- With a serrated knife, cut the tomatoes into ¼″ thick slices. Arrange them on a large 
serving platter, overlapping their edges and varying the shapes as best you can.
- Cut the burrata or mozzarella into ¼″ to ½″ slices (burrata is tricky since the inside is 
so creamy; I cut it into ½″ slices and gently tugged the slices into smaller sections, see photos). 
Tuck the cheese around and underneath the tomatoes, dispersing it relatively evenly across the platter.
- Sprinkle basil leaves all over, and tuck a few more into the crevices. 
- Drizzle the olive oil over the salad. 
- Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
- For the best flavor (if you have the time), let the salad rest for 30 minutes so the tomatoes release some juices and 
the flavors have time to mingle. 

## Notes

- This salad is best served within a few hours. 
- Leftovers will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.
