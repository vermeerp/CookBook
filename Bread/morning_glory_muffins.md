## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- One 8-ounce can crushed pineapple in juice
- 2/3 cup neutral oil (such as vegetable, grapeseed, or canola)
- 2 carrots, peeled, coarsely grated
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans (or any nut)
- 1/3 cup golden raisins (or any small pieces of dried fruit)
- 1/3 cup shredded coconut (sweetened or not, up to you)

## Instructions

- Preheat your oven to 375Â°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
- Whisk together the flours, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, spices, and salt in a large bowl. 
- Stir in the egg, pineapple and its juice, and oil to form a batter. 
- Stir in the carrots, pecans, raisins, and coconut.
- Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin wells.
- Bake the muffins until they're nicely browned and a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out clean, about 25 minutes. 
- Let the muffins cool before eating.

## Notes

- These muffins are filled with pineapple, carrots, nuts, raisins, and coconut - basically like carrot cake muffins. They're delicious right out of the oven, but leftovers can be split and put under the broiler or in a toaster oven to crisp them up a bit, or griddle them in a skillet with butter.
- The muffins can be stored in a tightly covered container at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen for up to a month.
