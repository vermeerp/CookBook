Yield: 12 (4-inch) pancakes

## Ingredients

- 2 cups rolled oats
- 2 very ripe bananas
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup Greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Butter (for cooking and serving)
- Maple syrup (for serving)

## Instructions

- Place the oats in a high-speed blender and blend until finely ground. Pour the oats into a large mixing bowl.
- Place the bananas, eggs, Greek yogurt, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in the blender and puree until smooth. Pour the mixture into the bowl with the ground oats and stir together.
- Set a large cast-iron skillet, griddle, or largest nonstick pan over medium heat and add a tablespoon of butter. Once the butter melts, swirl the pan or brush the griddle to evenly coat the surface.
- Pour the batter into the pan in 1‚ÅÑ4-cup increments to form pancakes roughly 4 inches in diameter. Cook only as many pancakes at a time as can fit comfortably on your cooking surface.
- Cook the pancakes until small bubbles appear on the surface and the undersides are nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until the second sides are nicely browned, another minute or so.
- Transfer finished pancakes to plates and continue making pancakes, adding more butter as needed, until all batter is used. Serve with butter and maple syrup.

## Notes

- Don't stress over making pancakes perfectly uniform in size - it's okay if they vary.
- Adjust heat as needed while cooking: turn down if pancakes are browning too quickly, turn up if they're pale and cooking too slowly.
- Cooking pancakes is a great way to build cooking intuition and heat control skills.
