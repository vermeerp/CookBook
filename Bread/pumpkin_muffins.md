- Add eggs, and beat well
- Mix in the pumpkin puree and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt, and pumpkin spice
- Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined
- If you'd like to add any additional mix-ins, like nuts, chocolate, or dried fruit, fold them in now
- Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups
- Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats
- Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean
- Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool

## Notes

- These muffins are delicious with mini chocolate chips (1/2 c) or chopped nuts (1/2 c).
- They are also good with dried cranberries or raisins (1/2 c).
- They are delicate until they cool, so let them cool before removing from the tin.
