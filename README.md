## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vermeerp/CookBook/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Actions will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Building Locally
To build and run the website locally, run
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [_config.yml](https://github.com/vermeerp/CookBook/blob/main/_config.yml) file.
