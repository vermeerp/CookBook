*Note: Dried beans double in volume and weight after soaking or cooking. Please do not fill the inner pot more than half capacity to allow for expansion. When cooking dried beans, use enough liquid to cover the beans. Beans and legumes are less likely to be over-cooked, but if they are undercooked the texture is typically unpleasant.*

**Instant Tip:** Although not strictly necessary, soaking the dried beans can speed up cooking significantly. Immerse the beans in 4 times their volume of water for 4-6 hours.

*Note: When steaming vegetables, you will need 1 cup (250 mL) of water and an ovenproof or steel bowl on a trivet. Due to short pressure keeping period, leaving the pressure cooker naturally cooling down without using steam release will add some extra cooking time to the food (Natural Release - see page 7).*

Instead of leaving the pressure cooker naturally cooling down, you'll need to open the pressure cooker using the Quick Release to release the pressure and stop cooking (see page 7).*
