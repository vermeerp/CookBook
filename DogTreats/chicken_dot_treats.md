# Chicken Dot Treats

This requires a silicone dot or pyramid baking sheet.  The recipe has been adapted to use
all tapioca flour because my dog can't have wheat flour.  The original recipe called for
1 c. tapioca and 1/2 c. white flour.

## Ingredients

- 10 oz. canned chicken, with the juices
- 2 eggs
- 1.5 cups tapioca flour
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 tsp garlic powder (optional)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
- Blend the chicken, its liquid, and 2 eggs in a food processor or high powered blender
- Pour the mixture into a bowl and stir in the flours and oil.  The batter should be a little thicker than
pancake batter, but still pourable.
- Spread about half the batter into the silicone mold.  Take time to get the batter into the holes, and to
clean off the dividers between the holes.
- Bake for 12 minutes
- Remove from the oven
- When the silicone sheet is cool enough to handle, turn it over and dump the treats out.
- Bag them up and refrigerate or freeze them.
