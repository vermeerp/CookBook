Total Time: 30 minutes
Yield: About 1 quart

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs - preferably duck eggs!
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 quart milk
- Vanilla to taste

## Instructions

- Heat the milk in a double boiler, stirring enough that it won't leave cooked milk at the bottom as it heats
- Use a pocket thermometer to check the temperature
- While the milk is getting hot, break the eggs into another container and mix in the sugar using a small hand whip
- When the milk shows about 120 degrees, put some into the egg-sugar mixture to temper it, then pour it all into the hot milk, stirring all the time
- Continue to stir and monitor the custard as it heats to 180 degrees
- Keep stirring constantly as the eggs will be cooking and it will want to stick to the bottom of the boiler
- Pour the hot custard through a sieve into another container for smoother texture
- Add vanilla at the end after cooking is complete
- Cool before serving

## Notes

- Making custard in smaller batches (one quart at a time) works better than doing large batches
- A wooden spoon works well for stirring, but the same whip used to mix the sugar and eggs can be used throughout
- Always add vanilla at the end - if added while cooking, the flavor will not be as good
- Use about a teaspoon of vanilla and taste-test by pouring a little into a juice glass
- The delicate vanilla aroma and flavor are never improved by too much boiling, baking, or poaching
