# Best Brussels Sprouts Ever


## Ingredients

- 1 pound Brussels sprouts
- 3 Tbsps butter, cut into smaller pieces
- 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 c water

## Instructions

- Use a 2 quart slow cooker
- Wash and trim the ends off of each Brussels sprout, and cut in half
- Toss into slow cooker
- Add the remaining ingredients and stir through
- Cover and cook on high for 1.5 - 2 hours, or on low for 3 to 4 hours
- Stir well to distribute the sauce before serving.

## Notes

- I reduced the cooking time because we like the sprouts crunchier, not cooked until mushy.
