## Ingredients

- 9 large eggs
  1/4 cup water or milk
  1/2 tsp salt
  1/2 tsp baking powder
  Ground black pepper, to taste
  Cooking spray
  
 ## Optional Mix Ins:
  
  Handful of spinach, finely chopped
  1/2 large bell pepper, diced
  Parmesan cheese, grated

## Instructions

- Into 6 or 8 quart Instant Pot, add 1 cup water. Please note silicone mold will not fit into 3 quart Instant Pot.
  In a 4 cup measuring cup, add eggs, water, baking powder, salt, pepper and whisk mixture with a fork or a whisk well.
  Spray 2 egg bite silicone molds with cooking spray well. Pour mixture into each of 14 openings of the mold about 2/3 full.
  If you would like, add toppings like veggies and cheese. No need to stir.
  Close each mold with silicone lid and stack in a staggered position, so the cups don’t line up. Then you won’t have lids sucked in and deformed bites.
  Then place on top of the trivet with handles. If your trivet doesn’t have handles, you might struggle getting mold placed carefully into a 6 quart pot. It is very tight and be careful not to spill.
  Place trivet Inside Instant Pot, close the lid, set pressure release valve to Sealing and press Pressure Cook on Low for 8 minutes.
  After do Quick Release by turning the valve to Venting. Using oven mitts and holding onto handles of the trivet or to the mold itself, remove molds with egg bites from Instant Pot.
  Open the lids, cool off a few minutes and using small silicone spatula go around the edge staying close to the walls of each opening and release egg bites one by one.
  Store: Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to  5 days.
  
  To Reheat Egg Bites: Because egg bites are small, they are quick to reheat. Pop a few on a plate in the microwave and reheat for 1 – 1.5 minutes from frozen or 30 seconds for fresh. It really depends on your microwave. For the fun fact, we do not have a microwave by choice. Maybe one day. I don’t mind my egg bites cold.
  
  To Freeze Egg Bites: Cook and cool egg bites. Pop in an airtight glass container with a lid and freeze for up to 3 months. If you want to freeze in a resealable Ziploc bag, lay egg bites flat first and then toss deeper into the freezer with frozen egg bites. They are just delicate.
  


## Notes

- I did not have Instant Pot pans available and used mini-muffin pans in the oven instead.
I baked at 350 for 15 minutes.
