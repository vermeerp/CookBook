## Ingredients

- One 9-inch pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
- 2 cups grated cheddar cheese (divided: 1 cup for bottom, 1 cup for top)
- 3 cups cooked vegetables (roasted zucchini, defrosted frozen broccoli, sautéed mushrooms, etc.)
- 3 large eggs
- 2/3 cup heavy cream 
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon other seasoning, to taste

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 9-inch pie dish with pie crust, trimming edges as needed.
- Prick the bottom and sides of crust with a fork. Line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights.
- Place pie dish on a sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes.
- Remove pie weights and parchment paper.
- Sprinkle 1 cup of cheddar cheese on the crust bottom. Evenly spread cooked vegetables on top.
- In a bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, salt, and pepper until well combined.
- Pour egg mixture evenly over vegetables. Top with remaining 1 cup of cheese.
- Bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned and filling is set, about 30 minutes.
- Let quiche cool completely before cutting into wedges and serving.

## Notes

- Split peas work well as pie weights - let them cool completely before storing back in jar
- Using a sheet pan makes transferring the pie dish much easier
- Any combination of cooked vegetables works well in this recipe
- I am trying lower-fat dairy instead of the heavy-whipping cream
- I am also trying feta cheese
- I think it could have less cheese too
